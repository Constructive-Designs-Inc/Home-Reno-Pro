# Copilot Instructions for Home-Reno-Pro

## Project Overview
Home-Reno-Pro is a Home Renovation Estimate Generator and Project Visualizer designed to help contractors and homeowners plan, estimate, and visualize home renovation projects.

## Project Purpose
This application aims to:
- Generate accurate renovation cost estimates
- Provide project visualization capabilities
- Help users plan and track renovation projects
- Offer tools for contractors and homeowners to collaborate on renovation planning

## Coding Guidelines

### General Principles
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Follow industry best practices for the technology stack used
- Prioritize user experience and accessibility
- Implement proper error handling and validation
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused on single responsibilities

### Code Style
- Use consistent indentation (prefer 2 spaces for web technologies, 4 for others)
- Follow language-specific conventions and linting rules
- Write clear, descriptive comments for complex logic
- Use descriptive commit messages following conventional commits format

### Development Practices
